Animation Idea

My idea is a concept based on the videogame RUINER, where it's main focus is the lack of humanity in a world controlled by corrupted corporations.

The feeling that I want to show is desperation and loneliness. A sense of claustrophobia by putting the main character under situations where his actions are dictated by a superior entity.

My idea is set in a futuristic city filled with death, corruption and poberty. My main colors to use will be a contrast of black and reds. Using neon lights a my main ilumination.
