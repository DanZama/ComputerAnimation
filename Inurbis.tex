\intslug[night]{Living room}
ATRION is sitting motionless in an old and damaged chair, waiting for a call.
\\~\\
He is wearing a strange cubic helmet, putting a big amount of weight in his head. 

\begin{dialogue}{cath}
WAKE UP PUPPY...
\end{dialogue}
The words are being displayed in ATRION's helmet. He quickly stands ups, with a hunched posture.

\begin{dialogue}{cath}
GRAB YOUR TOYS... 
\end{dialogue}

ATRION moves slowly to a table in the center of a room, filled with guns, weapons and swords. He grabs two pistols, a rifle, two grenades and a katana.

\begin{dialogue}{cath}
SOME TOYS ARE DIRTY. \\~\\
CLEAN THEM...
\end{dialogue}

ATRION checks carefully each weapon, cleaning the dry blood of the rifle and de blade of the katana. With his weapons cleaned, he equips them in him.

\begin{dialogue}{cath}
NEW TARGET...
\\~\\
-NAME: 424F42
\\~\\
-LOCATION: DURHAM CRYOSYSTEMS
\\~\\
-EXECUTION CONDITIONS: NONE
\end{dialogue}

ATRION heads towards the exit, leaving behind the rest of his guns.
\begin{dialogue}{cath}
GOOD PUPPY... UwU
\end{dialogue}

\extslug[night]{Street}
The tension in the city has been increasing with the recent murders of important heads in the government. The streets are not safe, not anymore.
\\~\\
A broken window can be seen on top of Durham Cryosystems' building, a dead body thrown out the window is falling to his death. From the top a silhouette can be seen, staring to the dead body.

\begin{dialogue}{Speaker IA}
Alert! A crime has been detected. \\~\\Stay out of the streets or you'll be terminated immediately.\\~\\
The police is on its way.
\end{dialogue}

Dozens of police cars arrive at the crime scene, knowing exactly where is the assassin located. Quickly they surround the building, searching for the responsible.

\begin{dialogue}{cath}
USE THE ROOFS...
\end{dialogue}
Up on the roof ATRION jumps to the closer building, causing the police to notice him immediately. The Police starts shooting at him with everything they got, chasing after him up the roof.

\begin{dialogue}{Speaker IA}
Criminal detected. We request you not to resist arrest or you'll be executed immediately.
\end{dialogue}
\begin{dialogue}{cath}
-> FIRE ESCAPE STAIRCASE TO YOUR RIGHT ->
\end{dialogue}
ATRION immediately turns to the right to the far end of a roof. He stops at the border noticing that there is no stairs, just a garbage dump down on the streets.

\begin{dialogue}{cath}
I MEANT TO YOUR LEFT... \\~\\
...SORRY >.<
\end{dialogue}

The police arrive to ATRION'S location, pointing him with their guns. ATRION is standing still, waiting for his orders.

\begin{dialogue}{cath}
END THEM...
\end{dialogue}

ATRION reaches to his hip where his katana is, but before he is able to do something gets shot directly in his helmet, destroying a part near his eye. The power of the shot throws him of the room, falling into the garbage dump.
 
\begin{dialogue}{Speaker IA}
The criminal has been eliminated. You can now return to the streets.\\~\\
Good day.
\end{dialogue} 
 
\intslug[night]{Alley}
Down the roof ATRION is lying unconscious on the garbage dump, the bags cushioned his fall. But a chunk of his helmet is destroyed, showing part of his face. 

\begin{dialogue}{cath}
WAKE UP... \\~\\
PUPPY? UnU
\end{dialogue}

Hours pass until ATRION finally wakes up, still on the dump. He gets up, noticing his clothes all covered in blood. Scared of the situation tries to run away.

\begin{dialogue}{cath}
I'M HAPPY YOU ARE ALIVE n.n\\~\\
RETURN HOME...
\end{dialogue}
ATRION stands still, disobeying his orders, he regained control of his body. Starts throwing his weapons.
\begin{dialogue}{cath}
ARE YOU OK?...\\~\\
\end{dialogue}
ATRION keeps ignoring the voice in his head.

\begin{dialogue}{cath}
OH I SEE, THIS IS BAD...\\~\\
SORRY...
\end{dialogue}

ATRION falls to his knees, shaking in pain. He is in incredible pain, unable to shout.

\begin{dialogue}{cath}
I AM SORRY...
\end{dialogue}

Suddenly ATRION stops shaking, he stands up. With tears on his eye looks around unable to move. He can see the blood on the floor, shining with the lights of the street.

\begin{dialogue}{cath}
YOU DISOBEYED ME...\\~\\
WAS FREEDOM WORTH IT?...
\end{dialogue}

Looking in fear ATRION bends down grabbing a gun and points it to his head. He didn't heard any order, but Cath is still controlling him.
A final message is seen on the helmet "SHOOT".
\\~\\
A gunshot is heard thought the streets of the city. A normal sound of a dreadful city, a city of dogs.

\begin{dialogue}{cath}
GOOD PUPPY...
\end{dialogue}
